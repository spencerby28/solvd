My virtual assistant has resulted in a major decrease in stress, with a major increase in productivity. My biggest struggle now is keeping her busy enough.‍‍
Kelby Gatrell

Marian is constantly searching for new things to learn & improve - this past week she even asked, “What more can I do?”‍‍‍
Jaron Erickson
Founder, CEO** _Dojo_**

We not only changed our profitability but we were also able to sell our company within two months of hiring our two Coconut VAs.‍
Grace McBride
CoFounder, CEO** _TripKit (acquired)_**

I hired an executive assistant and she's been amazing! The most important part for me, is that the way Coconut treats their VA's, providing them better pay, benefits and more to make sure they're taken care of.‍
Chris Hoffmann
Founder, CEO** _Equity Admin_**

My current Executive Assistant has been fabulous. She continues to meet and in many cases exceed my expectations. I am excited to continue working with her to help me scale and grow my business.
Paul Barnhurst
Founder** _The FP &A Guy_**

I would recommend Coconut VA to anyone that wants help buying back their time. I have worked with my VA for 3 years and he has always been a very valuable asset to our team.‍
Bruce Hymas
COO** _Wērkt_**

Coconut VA has been a lifesaver. My current VA is amazing. If you're on the fence about utilizing Coconut VA services, please don't hesitate. Jump onboard! You won't regret it!‍
Thea Blystone
Founder, CEO** _TM Pharmacy Consulting_**

They do a great job finding top notch candidates. They offer a premium service at a premium price, which I think is great starting out because you will get an understanding for the high level of talent that exists outside of the US. They set the bar high, and you benefit for it!‍
Phil Kirkeiner
CEO** _Baton Leads, Inc._**

I've been working with Astrid for the past 4 months and couldn't be happier. She has provided top tier creative development services for my business doing so with very little guidance in many cases.I really appreciated their vetting process, providing a shortlist of potential VA's that matched my criteria. Being able to meet the VAs before ultimately deciding on one was also hugely beneficial. Highly recommend!
Josh Sendler
CEO** _Josh Sendler Digital_**

Lea has been an invaluable member of our team since day 1. She has helped by pushing out grant applications on behalf of our clients and was our lead writer in this regard. As our business has transitioned, she has taken a leadership role in helping implement an internal application for us that will generate new business revenue and opportunities for us. 
Jonathan Stacey
Founder, CEO** _AltitudeB2B_**

Coconut VA has been a lifesaver for my business. It’s given me the flexibility to staff up when we have projects coming up, as well as find folks for our long-term roles. They sift through candidates, and provide us with an excellent talent pool to choose from. I can’t recommend them enough!
Heather Mason
Founder, CEO** _Caspian Agency_**

Coconut VA did a fabulous job sending me a list of qualified individuals to interview. In the end, we chose to work with Mike who is now an essential part of our team. Mike handles logistics as well as manages customer service and is now taking on high level projects. We are so grateful to the Coconut VA staff for their support and consistent follow-up. I highly recommend their services!
